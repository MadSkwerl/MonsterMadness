Created Change Log
Canceled HOTBAR_MOVE_AND_READD and HOTBAR_SWAP Events. To avoid de-stacking the charges artifact during these events
Also removed cleanChargesArtifact method in nsa and it's related delay call object, which was called when hotbar swapping
Removed Inventory Artifact. With future inv swapping mechanics it will not be necessary
Implemented respawning charges artifact in inv on death via player death player respawn and a few changes to player led

Updated implemented comments on powers up to 12.
Note Error Msg's spotted on death when Cause is charity sword. TODO

09/22/2019 JES
added generate power up to powers class for implemented powers
removed getMagnitude() from powers.
    -power magnitude will either be 1 (positive powerID) or 5 (negative PowerID).
    -Inf (powerID = 0) has no +5 magnitude, it just gives infinite ammo
    - powerID = -1 (wop of power id) will never be a power up (meaning -1 is ammo regen +5 in this context)


TODO:
powerup spawner:

takes either a location to spawn in world
or
