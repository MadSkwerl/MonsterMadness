09/22/2019 JES
added generate power up to powers class for implemented powers
removed getMagnitude() from powers.
    -power magnitude will either be 1 (positive powerID) or 5 (negative PowerID).
    -Inf (powerID = 0) has no +5 magnitude, it just gives infinite ammo
    - powerID = -1 (wop of power id) will never be a power up (meaning -1 is ammo regen +5 in this context)


TODO:
powerup spawner:
overloaded:
takes either a location to spawn in world
